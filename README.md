# Blackjack-Game
A simple Blackjack game.
This program is a console-based game which simulates casino-style Blackjack, with the exception that the dealer must reveal every other card he draws. The program generates a 52-card deck, shuffles it, and deals two cards to the player and the dealer at the beginning of the game, and then one card to the player and the dealer every turn after the first one. The dealer will keep drawing cards until he reaches 18, at which point he will stand. In each turn, the program asks the player to either hit or stand, upon which decision the player will have another card added to his deck, or the game will end. The program has an update system which will recognizes several automatic win/loss conditions, and also which will recognize who wins when the player decides to end the game.
